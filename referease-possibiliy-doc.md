# **ReferrEase - A Gamified Job Referral Web Application**

## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Overview**
ReferrEase is a web application designed to streamline job referrals by using a swipe-based interface similar to Tinder. The application connects potential job seekers (referees) with employees willing to refer candidates (referrers) for open positions. This eliminates lengthy LinkedIn conversations and accelerates the referral process.

### **1.2 Purpose**
The app aims to solve inefficiencies in traditional referral systems by providing:
- Faster communication between referrers and referees.
- A gamified approach to job referrals, making the process more engaging.
- Automated profile screening based on job eligibility.

## **2. Key Features**

### **3.2 Workflow**
1. Referees sign up, complete their profile, and start interacting with job listings.
2. If a referee expresses interest in a job and meets the criteria, their profile is visible to referrers.
3. Referrers review the applicants and shortlist or dismiss them.
